# am-localization
### Feel free to open PRs for missing translations and improvements.

The main branch of this repo is used as the definitive localization config for all supported Aftermath services. Currently, all translations live in the same file, though this is something I can change once the file size gets too large.

Here is a list of all languages that can be supported:
```
	"en"    // English
	"ru"    // Russian
	"pl"    // Polish
	"de"    // German
	"fr"    // French
	"es"    // Spanish
	"tr"    // Turkish
	"cs"    // Czech
	"th"    // Thai
	"ko"    // Korean
	"vi"    // Vietnamese
	"zh-cn" // Simplified Chinese
	"zh-tw" // Traditional Chinese
```

To create a translation for this language, just commit a file names `{code}.yaml` where `code` is the language code.
